description: One of the most popular authors of the Edwardian era, Sir Thomas Henry
  Hall Caine wrote a number of stories, novels, and plays that were eagerly lapped
  up by an adoring public, despite the fact that his politics and personal life were
  somewhat out of step with the strict mores and manners of the day. In The Christian,
  Caine tackles a number of sensitive issues about the practice of religion in the
  engaging and entertaining style that made him famous.
